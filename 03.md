# Lab Exercises Week 3: More Haskell, and Propositional Logic

## Expectations, pre-requisite knowledge

A reminder to read the first chapter of the book by O'Donnell, Hall and Page
(available under "Reading Resources"). Chapter 6 of that book is about
propositional logic - also of interest. Importantly, if you are behind with the
Haskell questions from last week, make sure you catch up (in your own time).

If you are unfamiliar with vim, but interested in using that editor, the lab
machines usually have "vimtutor" installed - try that.

## Learning objectives

At the end of the session you should have

*   consolidated Haskell programming skills, having written a recursive Haskell
    function, and having used user-defined ("algebraic") types;
*   used some Haskell code to explore concepts in propositional logic (module
    Prop).

## Activities

1.  Copy the scripts `BinTree.hs` and `Prop.hs` to your own directory.

2.  `BinTree.hs` defines a type `BinTree a` for binary trees, similar to what
    we did in a lecture. It provides a function `build_tree` that will take a
    list of items and generate a balanced binary tree. Extend it with a
    function `contents :: BinTree a -> [a]` which yields the tree's elements as
    a list, as discussed in this week's tutorial.

3.  Have a look at `Prop.hs`. You can use it from your own scripts like so:

    ```haskell
    import Prop

      -- Question 11(a): Check equivalence of two particular formulas

      tute_q11a :: Bool
      tute_q11a
        = logEquiv2 left right
          where
            left  p q  =  (not p) ==> q
            right p q  =  p ==> (not q)
    ```

    This will allow you to check your answers to some of this week's tutorial
    exercises.

4.  With the convention that we number a graph's nodes 0, 1, ..., n, we can
    represent a (non-empty) undirected graph as a pair (n, E) where n is the
    highest numbered node, and E is a set of edges, each edge represented as a
    pair of nodes. In Haskell, we may define

    ```haskell
    type Graph = (Int, [(Int,Int)])
    ```

    Write a function `wfg` to check that a graph is well-formed, that is, check
    that its edge component does not refer to a node labeled greater than n.

5.  A _graph colouring_ is an assignment of colours to nodes so that no edge in
    the graph connects two nodes of the same colour. The graph colouring
    problem asks whether a graph can be coloured using some fixed number of
    colours. The question is of great interest, because many scheduling
    problems are graph colouring problems in disguise. The case of three
    colours is known to be hard (NP-complete).

    The type definition

    ```haskell
    type Colouring = [Colour]
      data Colour    = Blue | Green | Red
                       deriving (Eq,Show)
    ```
                       
    exploits the fact that nodes are numbered 0, 1, ..., n, by defining a
    colouring of a graph as just a list of colours. The idea is that a list
    `colour` of type `Colouring` assigns colour `colour!!n` to node n. For
    example, if `colour` is the list `[Blue, Red, Blue, Red, Blue, Blue, Blue]`
    then nodes 1 and 3 are red and 0, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are blue.

6.  Write a function `well_coloured` such that `well_coloured graph col` is
    `True` if and only if the assignment of colours given by `col` is a
    blue-green-red colouring of `graph`.

7.  Last week we suggested you browse through this [Tour of the Haskell Prelude](http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS3211/lectureNotes/tourofprelude.html).
    You may also want to browse [the Prelude itself](https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/haskellch9.html)
    (good examples of Haskell programming).
