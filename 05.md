# Lab Exercises Week 5: List Comprehension; Xor Normal Form

## Expectations, pre-requisite knowledge

Lecture 6 is relevant also for this week's lab. This week's lab is relevant for
a later assignment.

## Learning objectives

At the end of the session you should have

*   consolidated your understanding of list comprehensions;
*   worked with user-defined types for XNF.

Once again, you may want to get together with your neighbour and go through the
questions together.

## Activities

1.  In case you did not complete last week's lab on resolution, better do that
    now. You will need the script `Resolution.hs` from last week.

2.  The attached script `Films.hs` contains a small film database and some
    predicates to help query it. Use list comprehensions to formulate these
    queries:

    1.  "Find all films that has Kevin Spacey as an actor."
    2.  "Find all actors that have also directed some film."
    3.  "Find all actors that have also directed some film, together with the films they acted in."
    4.  "Find all directors of films that were released after 2000."
    5.  "Find all films in which Harvey Keitel and John Travolta both acted."
    6.  "Give us all directors, together with their films and corresponding release dates."
    7.  "Find all director/actor pairs, for which the director has directed that actor."

3.  Copy the attached script `XNF.hs` to your directory and study it. It is a
    skeleton script for manipulating propositional formulas in so-called xor
    normal form (XNF).

4.  Lecture 6 mentioned that CNF and DNF are not canonical forms for
    propositional logic. In contrast, XNF _is_ canonical and can express all
    Boolean functions. It uses only exclusive or (⊕), conjunction (∧), and the
    constant **t** (that is, true). In XNF, a Boolean function is expressed as
    a sum of products, with addition corresponding to exclusive or, and
    multiplication corresponding to conjunction. For example, instead of P ∧ (Q
    ⇔ R) we write P ⊕ (P ∧ Q) ⊕ (P ∧ R). Actually we usually abbreviate this to
    P ⊕ P Q ⊕ P R, with the understanding that a "product" P Q is a
    conjunction. We call an expression like this - one that is written as a sum
    of products - a _polynomial_. Each summand (like P Q) is a _monomial_.
    There is no need for a connective for negation. Namely, if φ is a formula
    in XNF then φ ⊕ **t** is its negation.

    Tutorial question 32 discusses how a formula in XNF can be represented as a
    set of sets of propositional letters. In Haskell, we can use a
    list-of-lists representation, provided the lists faithfully mimic sets. To
    do this, the lists should be kept sorted and without duplicates. Make sure
        you understand the list-of-lists representation for formulas in XNF.
        Then complete `XNF.hs` by writing functions `myNot`, `myAnd`, `myOr`,
        `myNand`, `myNor`, `myXor`, and `myBiim`. The idea behind these
        functions should be clear; for example, `myAnd` (already defined) takes
        two formulas F and G in XNF and returns F ∧ G in XNF.

5.  You should also define constants `myFalse` and `myTrue` of type `Formula`,
    and a function `myLiteral` which can take an identifier such as "P" (a
    string) and turn it into the _formula_ P, in XNF.
