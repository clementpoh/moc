# Lab Exercises Week 2: Introduction to Haskell

## Expectations, pre-requisite knowledge

A good preparation for this week's lab class and tutorial is to read Chapter 1,
Introduction to Haskell, of the book by O'Donnell, Hall and Page (available
under "Reading Resources").

## Learning objectives

At the end of the session you should

*   be familiar with ghci for running Haskell programs;
*   have experienced writing a small Haskell program that works;
*   have overcome the usual anxiety associated with meeting a new programming language.

## Activities

If you are new to Haskell, you may want to concentrate on the first six or
seven problems (and return to the rest in your own time). If you reasonably
familiar with the language, maybe start from Question 6.

1.  Start up the interpreter WinGhci. At the prompt, type `:?` (colon-question
    mark) to see the various commands. Note in particular `:q`, `:l`, and `:e`.
    Also note the cryptic command called `<expr>`. What is meant by that is
    that you can type an arbitrary Haskell expression, and that will be taken
    as a request to find the expression's value. Try a few things with
    numerical and other expressions, like `6*12`, `1/7`, `2^5`, `7 == 13`, `8
    /= 11`, `sqrt(17) > 4`, `max 7 (3+5)`, `[1..24]`, etc.

2.  The universe is estimated to be 14,000,000,000 years old. Use ghci to find
    its age in nano-seconds. Is the number smaller or larger than 2 to the
    power of 100? (If at some stage ghci does not seem to respond, you can
    interrupt it; on a Unix system, type control-c; WinGhci offers a stop
    button in the toolbar.)

3.  Suppose you have a collection of 244 songs from which you want to select
    24\. How many different choices are possible? Well,
    K<sub>24</sub><sup>244</sup> = (221  222  ...  244)/(1  2  ...  24).
    To find the numerator, try the Haskell expression `product [221..244]`. Now
    try `let num = product [221..244]` followed by `num `div` product [1..24]`.
    The "div" with back-quotes is for integer division.

4.  We want to write a general function `k(n,m)` to find combinations like
    that. Exit ghci and create file called `k.hs`, with something like the
    following:

    ```haskell
    k : Integer -> Integer -> Integer
      k n m                                         -- find K^n_m (n over m)
        = numerator `div` denominator
          where
            numerator   = product <FILL THIS IN>
            denominator = product <FILL THIS IN>
    ```
    
    Fill in the missing details, then call `ghci k.hs` and sort out any
    problems with your code. Remember that indentation matters in Haskell (as
    in Python)! Try calling the function with different arguments. Will gchi
    find k 123456 12345 in reasonable time?

5.  Try to decipher the following expression, guess which value it has, and
    check using ghci:

    ```haskell
    [ x | x <- [1..4], y <- [x..5], (x+y) `mod` 2 == 0 ]
    ```

    For Python programmers: This is a list comprehension, but notice how the
    syntax is simpler - more like a set comprehension in mathematics.

6.  Take some time to browse through this [Tour of the Haskell Prelude](http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS3211/lectureNotes/tourofprelude.html).
    If you see anything interesting, experiment with it. The interactive ghci
    makes it quite easy to do that.

7.  Write a Haskell script for a function `xor` which takes Boolean arguments
    `x` and `y` and returns the Boolean value which is the "exclusive or" of
    `x` and `y`.

8.  Write a Haskell function `prime` which takes a natural number `n` and
    returns `True` if `n` is a prime number, `False` otherwise. One approach:
    First write a function which returns the list of numbers that divide `n`;
    then express `prime` in terms of the length of that list.

9.  Write a function `most_frequent :: [String] -> Char` which takes a list of
    strings and finds the most frequently occurring letter (element of
    `['A'..'Z']++['a'..'z']`) from those strings. Assume the strings only
    contain letters, and do distinguish upper and lower case. The attached file
    Elements.hs (see above) contains a list of strings denoting the first 108
    elements of the periodic table. In that list, which letter is the most
    common?

10.  If you find time, write a Haskell function `a2r` to translate a positive
     natural number to the corresponding roman numeral, using M=1000, D=500,
     C=100, L=50, X=10, V=5, and I=1\. For example, `a2r 2009` should yield the
     string `"MMIX"`. If you find more time, write a function to translate the
     other way too. For example, `r2a "DXXVI"` should yield 526\. If you have
     way too much time on your hand, add a function which checks that a string
     is a well-formed roman numeral.
