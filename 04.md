# Lab Exercises Week 4: Haskell, List Manipulation, and Resolution

## Expectations, pre-requisite knowledge

Before this week's workshop read the slides from Lecture 6 carefully. That is
the lecture on "Mechanised Reasoning", introducing the principle of inference
as resolution, in the propositional case.

And just to counter Les's Emacs crusade, a reminder that if you are unfamiliar
with vim, but interested in using that editor, the lab machines should have
"vimtutor" installed.

## Learning objectives

At the end of the session you should have

*   become better at list manipulation with Haskell;
*   seen more examples of higher-order functions in use;
*   experimented with a Haskell implementation of resolution, and improved it.

Since much of this lab class consists of reading and making sense of code, you
may want to get together with your neighbour and go through the questions
together.

## Activities

1.  The attached script `Resolution.hs` defines a type `Formula` to capture
    formulas in clausal (conjunctive normal) form. Copy it to your own
    directory, so that you can improve it.

2.  The type `Literal` is made an instance of several type classes: `Eq`,
    `Ord`, and `Show`. That means we can compare literals for equality and even
    order, and we can print them in a readable form. But what is the ordering
    on literals? Try out some cases, such as `Neg 'A' < Pos 'A'`, `Pos 'C' <
    Neg 'A'`, and `Pos 'A' < Neg 'A'`. Deduce how Haskell considers the
    elements ordered.

3.  The ordering carries through to lists of literals, and lists of lists. That
    is, we also have an (induced) ordering of clauses and formulas. Try out
    some of those cases, for example, `[Pos 'C', Neg 'B'] < [ Neg 'A', Pos
    'B']`, `[Neg 'A'] < [Neg 'A', Pos 'B']`, and `[Neg 'B'] < [Pos 'B', Neg
    'B']`. Deduce how Haskell considers these lists to be ordered.

4.  The function `resolvents` takes two clauses and returns the list of
    resolvents. In general there may be more than one resolvent: Try to call
    `resolvents` with the arguments `[Pos 'A',Pos 'B']` and `[Neg 'A',Neg
    'B']`. As this example shows, `resolvents` may sometimes produce clauses
    that are tautologies. These are awkward to have around - a clause which is
    always true may as well be removed. Fix `resolvents` so that it only
    returns resolvents that are non-tautologies. (The function `non_tautology`
    may be useful here.)

5.  Several functions make use of list processing functions not found in the
    Prelude. This is why an `import Data.List` directive is included. The
    `List` library gives access to many useful functions, including `(\\)` for
    list difference (so `xs \\ ys` is the list of those elements of `xs` that
    are not in `ys`). The function `nub` removes duplicates from a list. The
    function `sort` sorts a list. The script uses `nub` frequently (maybe too
    frequently?) to clean up clauses and formulas. The function `reduce` (which
    isn't really used anywhere) shows how `nub` can be used at different
    levels. However, when applied to formulas (lists of lists of literals),
    `nub` does not take into account that, say, `[Pos 'A', Neg 'B']` really is
    the same clause as `[Neg 'B', Pos 'A']`. Hence we end up treating `[[Pos
    'A', Neg 'B'],[Neg 'B', Pos 'A']]` as a formula with two clauses, when
    really it has only one. We could, however, make use of the fact that
    literals are in type class `Ord`. Write a function `normalise :: Clause ->
    Clause` that will sort a clause, in addition to doing what `nub` does.
    Where in the script would you use `normalise`?

6.  We have included a function `translate` that will translate a string such
    as `"$A-BC$-A-D$BCD"` into the formula

    ```haskell
    [[Pos 'A', Neg 'B', Pos 'C'],[Neg 'A', Neg 'D'],[Pos 'B', Pos 'C', Pos 'D']]
    ```

    This makes it easier to experiment with formulas. Study how its auxiliary
    function `tr` works. In particular, explain the roles played by `tr`'s
    three parameters.

7.  The function `unsatisfiable` makes use of the higher-order function
    `until`, defined as follows:

    ```haskell
    until :: (a -> Bool) -> (a -> a) -> a -> a
        until p f x
          | p x = x
          | otherwise = until p f (f x)
    ```
    
    The effect of `until p f x` is to compute `x`, `f x`, `f (f x)`, `f (f (f
    x))`, and so on, halting if/when the result satisfies the predicate `p`.
    Using `until`, write a function `collatz :: Integer -> Integer` which takes
    a positive integer n and repeats the following process until the result is
    1: If n is even, divide by 2; otherwise calculate 3*n + 1\. (The resulting
    function is uninteresting in the sense that it can only ever return 1\.
    However, it is _very_ interesting from a number theoretical point of view,
    because it is not clear that the process will always terminate. You can
    confirm that it terminates for all input up to 1000, for example with

    `sum [collatz n | n <- 1..1000]] == 1000`

    However, as of August 2016, nobody knows whether the process terminates for
    all input.)
