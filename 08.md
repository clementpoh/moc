# Lab Exercises Week 8: Implementing unification

## Expectations, pre-requisite knowledge

Once again, you may want to get together with your neighbour and go through the
questions together.

## Learning objectives

Many approached the mid-term test's question about resolution for the predicate
calculus without ever applying any substitutions in their resolution proof.
This lab is designed to make you more familiar with the concepts of terms,
substitutions and unifiers.

## Activities

1.  The attached file, `Unif.hs`, contains some rudimentary Haskell code
for unification of terms. Your task is to complete the code so that it will
solve tute question 37 for you. That is, we want a function `unify`
which takes two terms t1 and t2 and returns a most general unifier for t1 and
t2 if they are unifiable, and Fail otherwise.

	You can try to solve the problem without using the provided code; or you
can choose to use part of the script, or all of it, as is. If you plan to build
on top of it, keep reading.

	The script defines a type for terms, and a type for substitutions. For
example, the term `g(y,f(z))` is represented as `Fun "g" [Var "y", Fun "f" [Var
"z"]]`, and the substitution `[x |-> g(y,f(z))]` is represented as `Sub [("x",
Fun "g" [Var "y", Fun "f" [Var "z"]])]`. A constant `c` is represented as `Fun
"c" []` because we think of it as a function of arity 0.

	Familiarise yourself with the code.

2.  The definition of app is incomplete. Complete it and test it carefully
before proceeding.

3.  Once you have app working, test that @@ works as intended. It is for
composition of substitutions. So s1 @@ s2 applied to term t is the same as s1
applied to the result of applying s2 to t.

4.  Define the function unify.
